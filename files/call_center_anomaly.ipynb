    "A call center operation was under close scrutiny for uneven performance,\n",

    "the call center manager was engaging in favoritism, that certain employees were given\n",
    "unfairly easy working conditions, but no one was able to present a convincing case\n",
    "against the manager.\n",
    "## Complication: \n",
    "Some even went so far as to accuse the manager of nepotism --\n",
    "implying that the workers being given extra sweet deals were those that were related to\n",
    "the manager. The case was before a judge who, given the seriousness of the case,\n",

    "any hard evidence to prove that certain employees were being treated in a\n",
    "systematically different way than others. Can we do this using not one, but multiple\n",
